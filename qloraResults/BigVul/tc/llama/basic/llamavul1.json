The function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.\n\nHere's the reason:\n\nThe function `GetSwitchValueFromCommandLine` is designed to extract a value from a command line string based on a given switch name. It uses the `TokenizeCommandLineToArray` function to split the command line string into an array of arguments. Then, it iterates over the array to find the argument that starts with the given switch name followed by an equals sign.\n\nThe vulnerability lies in the fact that the function does not check the length of the argument before returning it. This means that if an attacker can craft a malicious command line string with a long argument that starts with the switch name and equals sign, they can potentially overflow the buffer used to store the return value.\n\nHere's the JSON output indicating the vulnerability:\n\n```json\n{\"VULNERABLE\": \"YES\"}\n```\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, the function should be modified to check the length of the argument before returning it, and ensure that it does not exceed the maximum allowed size."
