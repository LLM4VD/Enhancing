The function is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.\n\nHere's the reason:\n\nThe function uses the `nanosleep` function, which can be interrupted by a signal. If a signal is sent to the process while it's sleeping, the `nanosleep` function will return with an error, and the function will enter an infinite loop, retrying the sleep operation. This can lead to a denial-of-service attack, as the function will consume system resources and prevent other processes from running.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\"VULNERABLE\": \"YES\"}\n```\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, you can consider using a more robust sleep function that is not susceptible to signal interruptions, such as `usleep` or `sleep`. Alternatively, you can implement a timeout mechanism to limit the number of retries and prevent the function from consuming excessive system resources."

However, the function does not properly validate these inputs before using them.\n\nFor example, the `shape` field is not checked for valid values, and the `drawable` field is not checked for a valid drawable pointer.
