The function uses ` DCHECK` macros, which are not enabled by default and are only checked in debug builds. This means that in release builds, these checks are skipped, which could potentially lead to undefined behavior.\n\n4.  The function uses `MutexTryLocker` to lock a mutex, but it does not check if the lock was acquired successfully.
